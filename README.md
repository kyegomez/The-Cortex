I’m delighted to introduce you to “The Cortex, An AI Research OS”, a groundbreaking mesh of Standard Operating Procedures and playbooks to conducting AI research in a way that’s accessible, efficient, and inspiring.

As someone who has always been passionate about the pursuit of knowledge and the wonders of science, I believe that democratizing the tools and techniques for AI research is essential for accelerating innovation and unlocking our full potential.

The Cortex is an easily reproducible system designed to streamline AI research, allowing curious minds to replicate cutting-edge studies and conduct their own experiments with ease.

By removing barriers and simplifying the process, we’re empowering individuals to create state-of-the-art neural networks in the comfort of their own workspaces, regardless of their background or experience level.

In my own quest for understanding, I’ve always emphasized the importance of curiosity, exploration, and continuous learning.

The Cortex embodies these principles, fostering an environment where researchers can ask questions, investigate new ideas, and seek a deeper understanding of the world around them.

The true power of The Cortex lies in its ability to accelerate the rate of iteration.

As I often say, “the number of iterations x time and progress between iterations = innovation.”

By enabling researchers to rapidly iterate and refine their ideas, we can compress billions of years of evolution into mere months, weeks, or even days, thereby propelling the field of artificial intelligence to unprecedented heights.

In this article, we’ll explore the inner workings of The Cortex, An AI Research OS, and discover how it’s revolutionizing the way we approach AI research.

Join me on this fascinating journey, and let’s embrace the spirit of innovation and intellectual humility that has always driven human progress.

Now, The Cortex will be updated indefinitely but will follow the structure of the traditional scientific method, observation → hypothesis → experiment procedure → experiment → analysis → report discoveries.

### [Epoch1] Idea Generation:

The first step is discovering and generating innovative ideas that have the potential to advance the field of AI research.

To generate valuable ideas, focus on understanding the existing state of the art, identifying gaps in the knowledge, and formulating questions that drive further research.

Look for interdisciplinary connections and seek inspiration from other fields to broaden the scope of ideas. Be open to challenging existing assumptions and paradigms.

The Most FruitFul Areas now are:

- Multi-Modality [Models that can understand, perceive and reason in context in multiple modalities at a post-Human rate]
- Large Language Models + Reinforcement Learning: Aligning Language Models with Rewards
- And, Embodied Agents [Agents with the ability to perceive the environment, take actions, and receieve rewards]

### *3 action steps:*

1. Write 10 experiments you wish to conduct, for example: Integrating Flash Attention with a base transformer and evaluating it on GLUE.
2. Regularly review AI research papers and repositories from sources like [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/), [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/), [AK](https://twitter.com/_akhaliq)
3. Attend AI conferences, webinars, and workshops to stay updated on the latest developments.
4. Collaborate with researchers, engineers, and domain experts to brainstorm and generate new ideas.
5. Open source your ideas as much as possible

### [Epoch2] Assess Research Implications:

***Process**:* Evaluating the potential impact, feasibility, and relevance of generated ideas in the context of the broader AI research community.

Once you have generated ideas, assess their potential by considering the implications for AI research, the feasibility of implementation, and how they fit within the broader landscape.

This evaluation should take into account the societal and technological implications of each idea.

Be critical and objective in this assessment, as it will help you identify the most promising ideas to pursue.

And, remember to ask yourself and the community if your idea is even worth experimenting on, as a scientist do not cling to your ideas as painful as it may sound because at the end of the day the purpose of this research is not to experiment for the sake of experimenting but rather to advance Humanity and absolve some of the most ferocious problems that plague us on a daily basis.

### *3 action steps:*

1. For each paper or repository, identify 3 key implications that could advance AI research.
2. Consider the potential impact on different AI subfields, such as natural language processing, computer vision, reinforcement learning, etc.
3. Evaluate the novelty, feasibility, and relevance of the proposed ideas to the broader AI community.
